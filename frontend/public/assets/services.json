The traditional Swedish breakfast boards were custom made using pre-cut boards from IKEA. The Sweden cutout with a heart in our client’s city of birth made for a beautiful wall art that gives her a reminder of her hometown. The “FIKA” breakfast tray was engraved to be used for the traditional 3 o’clock snack time \"Fika\" in Sweden. This gift bundle showcases our laser cutting and engraving abilities.",

      "Description": "This pendant was created as a tribute to a lost dog, Sixten. Using a 3d scanner, a paw print which was pressed into clay over 5 years before his passing was scanned. Then the model was imported into Blender, a 3d modeling software, where all of the cracks and broken pieces from the clay were 3d repaired and textured to resemble the clay around it. After creating a clean 3d paw model using the scan, it was exported into another CAD software, where the model was scaled and had its pendant shape created. Then the file was sent to a local silversmith who used an ultra-high resolution 3d print out of wax to create a perfect silver replica of the 3d model. This was done by burning out the wax with the silver, leaving the silver paw behind.",
